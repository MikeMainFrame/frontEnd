# Front End assistance 
In order to choose between various front end assistance I have made solutions on same case with diffenrent assist.'

My story is old. I started 2000 and therefore I have not had these state problems.

And I used XSLt - which is a bit odd now, that we use JSON. But a mix of XSLT/XML helped me a lot.

The other problem was state - I have numerous ways of maintain state, but MVC is what the industry uses so I respect that.

I 2006 I make my first web shop - and with about 200 lines of script i supported FF and IE using XmlhttpRequest

I have made a lot of SPAs since and had some fun with jquery - but does not use it.
