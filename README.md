In order to choose between various front end assistance I have made solutions on same case with diffenrent assist.'

My story is old. I started 2000 and therefore I have not had these state problems.

The other problem was state - I have numerous ways of maintain state, but MVC is what the industry uses so I respect that.

React
Vue
Javascript
Angular (work in progress)
